# Neighborhood Map Project
This is the fifth project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree which is estimated to be completed in March, 2016. 

For this project, I'm using Knockout.js along with the Google Maps API and USDA National Farmers Market Directory API to create a mashup where visitors can search for Farmer's Markets near them by entering their zip code, then nearby Farmer's Markets will be shown on the map.
